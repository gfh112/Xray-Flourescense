# Xray-Flourescense
Here is the codes and data needed to reproduce the paper X-Ray Fluorescence from Super-Eddington Accreting Black Holes (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...884L..21T/abstract).

The data can be acessed at https://sid.erda.dk/sharelink/EV5q7TB3HB. After testing and optimization, I will upload the jupyter-notebooks. Please note the full data is aroun 1TB, so advised to only download and run on clusters.
